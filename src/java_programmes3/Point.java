/**
 * Write a class with the name Point. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name x and y of type int.
 * The class needs to have two constructors. The first constructor does not have any parameters (no-arg
   constructor). The second constructor has parameters x and y of type int and it needs to initialize the
   fields.
  Write the following methods (instance methods):
 * Method named getX without any parameters, it needs to return the value of x field.
 * Method named getY without any parameters, it needs to return the value of y field.
 * Method named setX with one parameter of type int, it needs to set the value of the x field.
 * Method named setY with one parameter of type int, it needs to set the value of the y field.
 * Method named distance without any parameters, it needs to return the distance between this
 Point and Point 0,0 as double.
 * Method named distance with two parameters x, y both of type int, it needs to return the distance
 between this Point and Point x,y as double.
 * Method named distance with parameter another of type Point, it needs to return the distance
 between this Point and another Point as double.
 NOTE: Use Math.sqrt to calculate the square root âˆš.
 NOTE: Try to avoid duplicated code.
 NOTE: All methods should be defined as public NOT public static.
 NOTE: In total, you have to write 7 methods.
